# Sally J's Learning Journal

## Growth Mindset
Growth Mindset is associated with greater master and learning behaviors instead of rote recall. This ability to test and learn is the foundation of coding. New ideas and new ways of creating the work is key to innovation and adaptive business. 
Practicing S.M.A.R.T. goals will teach the new coder how to build plans and scope their work that can be used in future professional situations.Along with all of these attributes, the Growth Mindset shifts the idea of failure to learning and evolution. 
### How to Stay in a Growth Mindset
1. Reflection: track what I've learned
1. Experimentation: test and learn
1. Failure: see failure as opportunity
1. Ask questions
